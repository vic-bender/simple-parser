# Simple Python Parser
This is a project that I created for Penn State's CMPSC461 class. This is a top-down parser for a custom professor-provided language, that runs and creates an AST based off of the string fed into it. This piece is a proof-of-concept work and has no real production value. 

Contents:
- .DS_Store (binary file, don't touch)
- ASTNodeDefs.py (AST Node Definitions)
- Parser.py (main parser logic)
- checker.py (unit tests)
- grammar.txt and tokens.txt (grammar and token definitions respectively)
- verify.py (runs unit tests)
